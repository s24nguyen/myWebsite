      <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Steven Nguyen and I am a web developer in training. I just recently graduated from college 
        and realized that I have not created a personal website yet. So here it is! On this site you will learn a little bit about myself - what my background is, 
        what my hobbies are, some of my past projects, and my portfolio of baked goods...you know...in case my web development plan goes south and I need to open up a bakery shop!

        <h4>School of Engineering and Computer Science</h4>
        <p>Bachelors of Science in Information Technology</p>

      <p>When I first began college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Before committing to IT, I thought about other areas such as culinary arts, 
        graphic design, and marketing. After a lot of thought, I ultimately ended up choosing IT in 2014 and thus, began my journey where I eventually discovered my desire to be a 
        web/software developer.<br> (Add more stuff to this when I think of something else to say...)
